# Secure-CI-CD-Pipeline-from-Azure-Repos-to-AKS
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end deployment pipeline that integrates Azure Repos (Azure DevOps Git repository) with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to deploy containerized applications securely and efficiently.

It includes Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and security best practices to ensure a robust production-ready Kubernetes deployment on Azure.

Key Features
Source Code Management: Azure Repos Git repository to maintain application and infrastructure code.

Infrastructure Provisioning: Terraform scripts to provision Azure resources including AKS clusters, networking, and supporting services.

Containerization: Docker container images built and stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

CI/CD Pipelines: Automated build, test, and deploy pipelines using Azure Pipelines.

Secure AKS Deployment:

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Kubernetes authorization.

Network policies and Azure Private Link for cluster security.

Secrets management with Azure Key Vault integration.

Image scanning and vulnerability assessment.

Monitoring & Logging: Integration with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for cluster health and application monitoring.

Prerequisites
Azure subscription with permissions to create resources

Azure CLI installed and configured

Terraform installed

Docker installed

Azure DevOps project with Azure Repos and Azure Pipelines enabled

kubectl CLI installed

Deployment Steps
Provision Azure Infrastructure
Run Terraform scripts to provision AKS, ACR, and networking.

Build and Push Docker Images
Build application container images and push to Azure Container Registry.

Configure AKS Cluster
Deploy Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts to AKS cluster using kubectl or Helm.

Set up CI/CD Pipelines
Configure Azure Pipelines for automated builds and deployments triggered on commits.

Apply Security Controls

Enable RBAC and Azure AD integration for AKS authentication.

Configure network policies and private endpoints.

Store secrets securely in Azure Key Vault.

Implement container image scanning in pipeline.

Monitor and Manage
Use Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Alerts for continuous monitoring.

Security Best Practices
Least Privilege Access: Assign minimal required permissions for users and services.

Network Isolation: Use Azure Virtual Networks and Network Security Groups.

Secure Secrets: Integrate AKS with Azure Key Vault for secrets management.

Image Vulnerability Scanning: Integrate tools like Trivy or Azure Security Center.

Audit and Logging: Enable AKS audit logs and Azure Policy for compliance.

Regular Updates: Keep Kubernetes and base images up to date.
